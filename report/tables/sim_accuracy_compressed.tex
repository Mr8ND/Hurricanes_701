\caption{Accuracy and precision of PBs created from 309 different starting points, with PBs analyzed across all 4 types of simulated curves. Median pointwise and uniform accuracy as defined in Appendix \ref{sec:validity_and_effiency} obtained for each PB attempting to capture 100 newly simulated curves from the same distribution that defined the PB. Median area recorded in square nautical miles.}
